In this article we&rsquo;re going to take a deeper look at the <i>Circle of Life</i> in
Aurora DSQL. Understanding the flow of data will really help you wrap your head
around the DSQL architecture, and how best to build applications against DSQL.
</p>

<p>
My intention in sharing this article is help you understand the <i>flow</i>. There
are many other things to understand: availability, scalability, durability,
security, and so on. I won&rsquo;t be discussing those in detail, because each of
those topics is deep and complex, and deserves its own focus.
</p>

<h3 id="org45aa156">The flow of data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org45aa156">
<p>
Aurora DSQL is based on PostgreSQL. The Query Processor (QP) component <i>is a
running postgres process</i>, although we&rsquo;ve significantly modified it to work with
our architecture.
</p>

<p>
If you connect to DSQL with a Postgres client (such as <code>psql</code>), you&rsquo;re connected
to one of these postgres processes. You&rsquo;re connected to a QP, and you can start
to interact with it as you would with any other Postgres server.
</p>

<p>
If you run a <i>local</i> Postgres operation, such as <code>SELECT 1</code>, then that query is
processed entirely locally by the QP. But what happens when you query a table:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">select</span> * <span style="color: #51afef;">from</span> test;
 id | <span style="color: #51afef;">value</span>
<span style="color: #5B6268;">----</span><span style="color: #5B6268;">+-------</span>
  <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> |    <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">10</span>
(<span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">row</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Usually, you&rsquo;d expect Postgres to read from storage <i>locally</i>, which might mean
reading from the buffer cache, or doing disk I/O. When running on Aurora
Postgres (APG), cache misses would result in a load from <i>remote</i> storage.
</p>

<p>
Like APG, reads in DSQL also go to <i>remote</i> storage. In our above query, which
is a scan of the entire <code>test</code> table, the QP is going to turn around and scan
storage, and storage is going to return all the rows in the table.
</p>

<p>
But how did storage get the rows in the first place?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">insert</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">into</span> test <span style="color: #51afef;">values</span> (<span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span>, <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">10</span>); <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">autocommit</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Vanilla Postgres would process that transaction locally, inserting into the
Write-Ahead Log (WAL), updating the buffer cache, and using <code>fsync()</code> to persist
the changes to disk. In APG, the buffer cache is also updated, but the
durability of the transaction is ensured by <code>fsync()</code> to the remote storage in
multiple Availability Zones (AZ).
</p>

<p>
Commits in DSQL have the same basic ingredients, but they&rsquo;re expressed quite
differently. In DSQL, data is durabily persisted when it&rsquo;s written to the
<i>journal</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. Storage follows the journal, and keeps itself up to date.
</p>

<p>
When I first started working on DSQL (many years ago!), I didn&rsquo;t <i>really</i> get
this flow. I&rsquo;d been told &ldquo;writes go to the journal, reads go to storage&rdquo;. I
nodded, but I didn&rsquo;t deeply, truly, understand that simple explanation. I&rsquo;d
spent too much time with traditional architectures, and my mind kept falling
back on the familiar.
</p>

<p>
What helped me get it was the picture at the top of this post. Imagine somebody
drawing this on the whiteboard. They draw the three boxes: QP, journal and
storage. Then, they draw the Circle of Life:
</p>


<figure id="org32e645f">
<img src="images/circle1.png" alt="circle1.png">

</figure>

<p>
There&rsquo;s something about this presentation, vs. the one at the top of the
article, that helped it go <i><b>click</b></i> for me. Removing the service interactions
certainly helps. Notice how in the first picture there&rsquo;s an arrow <i>from</i> the QP
<i>to</i> storage, while in the Circle, the arrow is the other way round?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Writes go to the journal, reads go to storage&rdquo;, never quite did it for me.
&ldquo;Writes never go to storage, reads never go to the journal&rdquo; also didn&rsquo;t quite
the message across. The Circle did for me, and I hope it does for you.

<h3 id="org6833c4d">The flow of time</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6833c4d">
<p>
Now you may be thinking: <i>How do we know that storage is up to date?</i> We&rsquo;ve just
inserted our <code>(1, 100)</code> tuple and got a successful commit. Then, we run our
table scan. <i>What if storage isn&rsquo;t up to date?</i> What if there&rsquo;s some kind of
delay on the network, preventing storage from learning about the new row?
</p>

<p>
The change is <i>trying</i> to reach storage, but it&rsquo;s stuck in traffic:
</p>


<figure id="org0f0f9a7">
<img src="images/circle2.png" alt="circle2.png">

</figure>

<p>
The answer to this question is quite beautiful, and it&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;m
most excited about with DSQL. Because the answer is absolutely not &ldquo;eventual
consistency&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
You see, it&rsquo;s not just <i>data</i> that&rsquo;s flowing around the Circle, it&rsquo;s <i>time</i> too.
Every transaction has a start time T<sub>start</sub>. This time comes from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/its-about-time-microsecond-accurate-clocks-on-amazon-ec2-instances/">EC2 Time
Sync</a>, which provides us with microsecond-accurate time. When the QP queries
storage, it doesn&rsquo;t just ask &ldquo;give me all the rows in the <code>test</code> table&rdquo;.
Instead, it adds &ldquo;.. as of T<sub>start</sub>&rdquo;. When the QP writes data to the journal,
it computes the commit time and then says &ldquo;store this data at T<sub>commit</sub>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The journal provides an ordered stream of both time and data, which means
storage can know precisely when it has all the data to answer the query.
</p>

<p>
As somebody who&rsquo;s spent an awful amount of time debugging and trying work around
bugs caused by eventual consistency, I really cannot overstate how delighted I
am with this design property. In DSQL, you never have to deal with eventual
consistency. You either get:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the right answer immediately,</li>
<li>or you get the right answer with a slight delay,</li>
<li>or you get an error (and we get paged).</li>
</ol>

<p>
You never get the wrong answer - you never get stale data.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, we&rsquo;ve put an enormous amount of engineering effort into keeping
the cases of delays as infrequent as possible even in the event of hardware or
networking failures.

<h3 id="orged5f4e6">Implications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orged5f4e6">
<p>
I&rsquo;m going to share some <i>positive</i> implications of this architecture. In a
future article, we&rsquo;ll talk about some of the patterns that don&rsquo;t work so well on
this architecture, and what you should do instead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org619676f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org619676f">It scales like crazy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org619676f">
<p>
The whole point of a distributed architecture like DSQL is to enable better
scalability, availability and so on (read <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/01/02/why-distributed.html">Why do we need distributed systems?</a>).
DSQL is designed to scale horizontally. If you open a second connection to DSQL,
your picture now looks like this:
</p>


<figure id="org2615b4f">
<img src="images/circle3.png" alt="circle3.png">

</figure>

<p>
If you open more connections and do more (and more) reads, DSQL will detect the
increase in traffic, add more storage capacity, and now suddenly you have:
</p>


<figure id="org57f6307">
<img src="images/circle4.png" alt="circle4.png">

</figure>

<p>
The same idea is true of the journal, and all the other DSQL architectural
components that I&rsquo;m not showing here. DSQL scales horizontally. If we&rsquo;re running
out of something, we just add more of it. We&rsquo;re also able to <i>partition</i> data
up; there&rsquo;s nothing in this picture that says any of the storage boxes needs to
contain <i>all</i> the data.
</p>

<p>
In DSQL, scaling is completely hands-free. If you&rsquo;ve opened more than one
connection to DSQL, you&rsquo;ve already scaled out.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge32eed4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge32eed4">No eventual consistency</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge32eed4">
<p>
In DSQL, there is <b>no eventual consistency, at any scale.</b>
</p>

<p>
Most deployments of relational databases run into this problem. Your primary is
running hot. You realize you have way more reads than writes. So you add a read
replica.
</p>

<p>
But now you need to teach your application about read replicas. Which queries
should go to the primary, which should go to a replica?
</p>

<p>
Then you add more replicas. How do I learn about all the replicas, how do I load
balance across them?
</p>

<p>
Replicas are usually up to date, and so you might not realize how many bugs
you&rsquo;ve just introduced. Sooner or later, things are going to slow down, and now
you need to go find all the cases where you really did need to ensure you had
the latest data. If I sound like I have some eventual consistency trauma, that&rsquo;s
because I do.
</p>

<p>
In DSQL, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about any of this. <i>DSQL</i> automatically manages
the internal capacity for your cluster. <i>DSQL</i> automatically ensures your
queries have fresh data.
</p>

<p>
This property goes hand-in-hand with hands-free, automatic scaling. If adding
storage replicas were to introduce eventual consistency, then we couldn&rsquo;t do it
automatically.
</p>

<p>
But it gets even cooler than that.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd9212bb" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd9212bb">No eventual consistency, even across Regions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd9212bb">
<p>
In DSQL, there is <b>no eventual consistency, at any scale, even when doing
multi-Region.</b>
</p>

<p>
The Circle of Life doesn&rsquo;t care about being in the same AWS region. Let&rsquo;s look
at multi-Region. Depending on how you&rsquo;re reading this article, you might want to
open the next picture in a new tab:
</p>


<figure id="org235a045">
<img src="images/circle5.png" alt="circle5.png" style="position:relative; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%) scale(0.55); transform-origin: center; max-width: none;">

</figure>

<p>
What&rsquo;s really important to emphasize here is that reads are <i>always local</i>. If
you insert data into the region on the left and then read it from the region on
the right, the <i>read</i> in the region on the right <i>is fast and local</i>. The QP on
the right has absolutely no clue where the data came from, nor does storage. The
QP just says &ldquo;hey, give me the data as of T<sub>start</sub>&rdquo; and storage just waits
until it&rsquo;s seen everything and then returns the results.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s the story I like to tell: imagine you have a DSQL cluster somewhere on
planet Earth, and another, peered, cluster somewhere far away - say&#x2026;on the
Moon. On Earth, we insert some data:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">insert</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">into</span> test <span style="color: #51afef;">values</span> (<span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span>, <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">10</span>); <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">autocommit</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The Internet tells me it&rsquo;s about 2.5s RTT to the Moon, so expect about that much
latency on commit. The spooky bit comes next. A user in either location can then
run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">select</span> * <span style="color: #51afef;">from</span> test;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
No matter whether you&rsquo;re on Earth, or on the Moon, you&rsquo;re going to see the
inserted row (no eventual consistency), and you&rsquo;re going to see it with low
latency. This may seem like magic. Are we breaking the laws of physics? Not at
all; the reason the commit took 2.5s was to get the data on the moon. So, by the
time the astronaut runs her query, there&rsquo;s no need to wait.

consistency even across AWS regions.

intuition as to where DSQL can solve some of the problems you might be facing.
