In this article, I&rsquo;m going to explain how connections to Aurora DSQL are
authenticated and authorized. This information is meant to be supplemental to
what is found in the official <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/">Amazon Aurora DSQL</a> documentation.
</p>

<p>
This is a &ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo; explanation, rather than a &ldquo;how to&rdquo; guide. After
reading this article you should understand:

If you are already familiar with Postgres or AWS authentication, I&rsquo;m not sure
how much value you&rsquo;re going to get out of this post. However, I know that there
are many people out there who understand the Postgres piece, but no the AWS
piece or vice-versa. All the information is already out there, but to my
knowledge, there aren&rsquo;t many articles that really lay it all out end-to-end.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do here.

<h3 id="orgfe2e448">Authentication and authorization in Postgres: a recap</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfe2e448">
<p>
<i>Authentication</i> is about establishing <i>who</i> is connecting to the database.
</p>

<p>
Authentication is easy. My name is Marc. Now you know. That wasn&rsquo;t so hard, was
it? Well&#x2026; do you really know? Why should you trust that I am who I say I am?
</p>

<p>
In the real world, we are asked to validate our identity all the time. If you
take a flight, you may be asked to display a driver&rsquo;s license or passport.
Authentication requires <i>verifying</i> identity.
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL has a number of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html">Authentication methods</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Trust</i> authentication, which simply trusts that users are who they say they are.</li>
<li><i>Password</i> authentication, which requires that users send a password.</li>
<li>.. and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>
These authentication methods are built into both Postgres clients and servers.
Not all authentication methods are supported by all clients or by all servers.
</p>

<p>
When a Postgres client connects to a Postgres cluster<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, the following
messages are exchanged over the wire:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>client -&gt; server: My name is <code>$user</code> and I&rsquo;d like to login to <code>$dbname</code></li>
<li>server -&gt; client: Sure, tell me your password</li>
<li>client -&gt; server: ilikecats</li>
</ol>

<p>
No authentication model is fool proof - it&rsquo;s all about building confidence. In
this case, the server trusts that I&rsquo;m in fact Marc because I told the server a
secret that I had previously shared with the server. And because nobody else
should know that secret, I am therefore me.
</p>

<p>
<i>Authorization</i> is about establishing <i>what</i> an authenticated user can do.
Authorization is often oriented around verbs or actions.
</p>

<p>
New connections always take a default action: <code>LOGIN</code>. If you create a
role<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">postgres</span>=&gt; CREATE ROLE test password <span style="color: #98be65;">'...'</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then you will not be able to login to the cluster. You need to authorize logins:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">postgres</span>=&gt; CREATE ROLE test WITH LOGIN password <span style="color: #98be65;">'...'</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In Postgres, roles can have complex permissions such as which tables a role can
see or modify. When you run a SQL statement like <code>INSERT INTO my_table ..</code>,
there may be (surprisingly) many authorization checks which run to ensure you
can do everything you&rsquo;re trying to do.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge7c996d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge7c996d">The trouble with passwords</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge7c996d">
<p>
In a normal Postgres installation, a cluster would be configured with a
&ldquo;root&rdquo;-like user (often called &ldquo;master&rdquo;, &ldquo;admin&rdquo;, &ldquo;superuser&rdquo;, or similar) that
has permission to do anything. Then, the root user would be used to create
additional roles with scoped-down permissions (principal of least privilege).
Protecting the password of the &ldquo;root&rdquo; account is (especially) critical; if an
attacker learns that password then they too can do anything.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, keeping passwords secure is frustratingly difficult. It is all
too easy to accidentally log a password, include it in source control, in a
stack trace, or in a memory dump.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you&rsquo;re submitting a bug report online, and in the process of reporting
the bug you accidentally included your database password in the bug report. What
happens next? After one second, probably nothing. But it&rsquo;s only a matter of
time before a malicious actor finds the password and tries to use it.
</p>

<p>
One of the ways to mitigate this threat is to rotate passwords. Every so often
you change the password to something else. Let&rsquo;s say you rotate passwords every
week. If you leaked a password and it took a month for an attacker to find it,
then you&rsquo;re protected because the leaked password is no longer valid.
</p>

<p>
Building password rotation into your system is conceptually simple, but
practically non-trivial. You need to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Have a place to store and distribute passwords so that clients can learn the
current password.</li>
<li>Define a mechanism to rotate passwords. When does the server learn the new
password? How and when do clients learn the new password?</li>
</ol>

<p>
This turns out to be a lot of work, which is why <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html">Password management with Amazon
RDS and AWS Secrets Manager</a> exists.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, rotating passwords once a week (or day) just isn&rsquo;t good enough.
Attackers are constantly trawling the Internet for password leaks. It may only
take a few seconds between leaking a password and it being discovered and
exploited.
</p>

<p>
This is where defense in depth comes in. A common practice in AWS is to limit
network access to the database, such as by using a private VPC subnet or by
using security group rules.
</p>

<p>
As previously mentioned, Postgres supports a number of other authentication
methods. If passwords are so problematic, why not try one of those? Well, the
problem isn&rsquo;t really with <i>passwords</i>. If you used <i>Certificate</i> authentication,
you&rsquo;d have the same fundamental problem: what happens if you leak the
certificate?
</p>

<p>
The real trouble is with the <i>lifetime</i> that a password (or certificate, etc.)
is valid for. If you could rotate passwords every second, then that&rsquo;d be great.
But, that turns out to be difficult to do in practice.

<div id="outline-container-org62e7017" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org62e7017">How do AWS services handle authentication and authorization?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org62e7017">
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">aws s3 <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">ls</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
How does S3 know who you are? How does S3 know that you&rsquo;re allowed to call the
<code>ListBuckets</code> operation?
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s unpack <i>authentication</i> first. In order to do that, I need to explain how
AWS credentials work. Remember, authentication requires proof. Credentials are
how we&rsquo;re going to prove our identity.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s pretend we have some AWS credentials. We went to the IAM (Identity and
Access Management) console, made an IAM user and then downloaded credentials.
AWS credentials are similar to a username and password, but with different
names. <code>$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> is the &ldquo;username&rdquo;, <code>$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> is the
&ldquo;password&rdquo;. You should never share your secret key, in the same way that you
should never share your password. Secret keys are not actually passwords, we&rsquo;ll
get to that.
</p>

<p>
At this point I feel obliged to say: <span class="underline">Please don&rsquo;t use long-lived credentials.</span>
Later, I&rsquo;m going to explain what you should do instead, and why it&rsquo;s so much
better. But for now, let&rsquo;s roll with it, because we need to understand the
simple version first.
</p>

<p>
If you make a request to an AWS service, you&rsquo;re really making a Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) request over HTTPS. Try this out:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">aws --debug s3 <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">ls</span> <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">2</span>&gt;&amp;<span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> | <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">grep</span> <span style="color: #98be65;">"http request"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What you&rsquo;ll see is a HTTPS <code>GET</code> request with some headers. One of those headers
is <code>Authorization</code><sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. Like Postgres, HTTPS also supports multiple kinds of
authentication. From Mozilla&rsquo;s documentation on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#authorization_and_proxy-authorization_headers">HTTP authentication</a>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">Authorization: &lt;type&gt; &lt;credentials&gt;
Proxy-Authorization: &lt;type&gt; &lt;credentials&gt;

Some common authentication schemes include:

Basic

    See RFC 7617, base64-encoded credentials. More information below.

&lt; ... &gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The way Basic <i>type</i> works is you simply transmit your user-password in the
<code>Authorization</code> header. That&rsquo;s really simple, but not very secure. If anybody
intercepts the request, they have your password and can then make other requests
on your behalf. This is <span class="underline">absolutely not</span> how AWS does it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">GET /
Authentication: Basic $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We need to send something, and it can&rsquo;t be the secret key. What we want to do is
send something that proves we <i>have</i> the key. This is where cryptography comes
in, and it&rsquo;s why secret keys aren&rsquo;t actually passwords. They&rsquo;re cryptographic
keys. Instead of transmitting the <code>$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> in plain text, the
key is going to be used to <i>generate a signature</i>.
</p>

<p>
Imagine we have a request that looks like this<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">GET /
Host: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Foo: Bar

&lt;body of the request /&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The signing process is going to <i>alter</i> the request to look like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">GET /
Host: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/&lt;etc&gt;, SignedHeaders=Host, Signature=$SIGNATURE
Foo: Bar

&lt;body of the request /&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What&rsquo;s important to understand here is that:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The <code>$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> <i>is</i> transmitted</li>
<li>The <code>$AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> is not transmitted</li>
<li>Instead, a signature is sent</li>
</ol>

<p>
Signatures are a cryptographic concept that provide authenticity (you know who
signed the message) and integrity (you know that the message wasn&rsquo;t tampered
with).
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s cool about this is that if a request is intercepted as plaintext
(remember, HTTPS is being used), the <i>signature</i> cannot be used to generate new
signatures; <i>you need the key</i> to be able to generate signatures. This means
that you intercept a request to list objects in a S3 bucket, you cannot then
also download or delete objects. The only thing you can do with an intercepted
request is replay it (later, we&rsquo;ll see how that too has limited utility to an
attacker).
</p>

<p>
So how are signatures actually generated? It&rsquo;s right there in the <code>&lt;type&gt;</code>,
silly: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256. &ldquo;AWS4&rdquo; is short for &ldquo;AWS Signature version 4&rdquo;, which is
an algorithm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> stands for Hash-based Message Authentication Code. And SHA256
is a cryptographic hash function. So&#x2026; what is a MAC?
</p>

<p>
Imagine you&rsquo;re doing something really important. Like defusing a bomb (sorry).
And you&rsquo;re waiting for me to tell you which wire to cut. You get a text from an
unknown number: &ldquo;cut the blue&rdquo;. You might, at this point, wonder what to do.
</p>

<p>
How do you know that the message came from me? And, if it did come from me, how
do you know it wasn&rsquo;t tampered with?
</p>

<p>
Turns out that you and I have a secret protocol. Whenever we text each other, we
count the number of characters in the message and add that to the end. &ldquo;cut the
blue (12)&rdquo;. That might help with your confidence. For example, you&rsquo;re now more
confident that the message was not, in fact: &ldquo;DO NOT cut the blue&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The problem with this protocol is that it doesn&rsquo;t really help you with your
other concerns. How do I know the baddy isn&rsquo;t texting me to get me to cut the
wrong wire and set the bomb off? Obviously, you need cryptography.
</p>

<p>
This is where Message Authentication Codes (the MAC part) come in. The H stands
for Hash-based. An HMAC is generated over the message and then transmitted with
the message. The receiver can then trust that the message came from somebody
with the shared secret (and hopefully the baddy doesn&rsquo;t have it) and that it
wasn&rsquo;t somehow altered en route. What&rsquo;s nice about HMACs is they&rsquo;re both fast
and produce a fixed length output.
</p>

<p>
The AWS Signature version 4 algorithm is a set of operations that involve HMACs.
The most important thing to understand is that critical HTTP headers and the
HTTP body is included in the calculation. As with our bomb defusal story, this
means that AWS services can validate the sender of the message and that the
message was not tampered with.
</p>

<p>
If you want to learn more about how AWS4 actually works, I recommend watching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpTpcUA_F2w">How AWS SIGv4 and SIGv4A work</a>.
</p>

<p>
I promised I&rsquo;d explain replay attacks, so here we go. AWS requests include a
<code>x-amz-date</code> header<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>, and this header is included in the signature (which
means it cannot be tampered with). AWS services will refuse to process requests
where the date is too far from &ldquo;now&rdquo;. This means that if a request is
intercepted, it can only be replayed within this window. An attacker cannot
change the date, because that would invalidate the signature. And, intercepting
plaintext requests in real time is quite difficult because of TLS. It may be
possible to grab ciphertext requests and eventually decrypt those, but by the
time you&rsquo;re done doing that the validity window will have lapsed.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you should have a good understanding of <i>authentication</i>. To
recap:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Your client is configured with AWS credentials</li>
<li>A HTTP request is produced (with headers and a body), but not sent</li>
<li>The request is <i>signed</i>, adding additional headers (importantly: a signature)</li>
<li>The request is transmitted over TLS to AWS (HTTPS)</li>
<li>AWS validates the request&rsquo;s signature</li>
<li>.. and in so doing knows who made the request</li>
</ol>

<p>
Next, <i>authorization</i>. I&rsquo;m going to breeze through this one, since it&rsquo;s a
universe unto itself. For now, all you need to know is that the AWS service
will:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Lookup the policies for the authenticated caller</li>
<li>Look at the request</li>
<li>Evaluate whether the request should be allowed</li>
</ol>

<p>
This looks a whole lot like what Postgres does. When you run <code>DROP TABLE</code>,
Postgres is going to lookup your permissions, look at your SQL, and then
determine if you&rsquo;re allowed to do that or not.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd4e3bc8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd4e3bc8">Presigned requests</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd4e3bc8">
<p>
Remember how we talked about replay attacks? If you intercept a plaintext signed
request to an AWS service, then you can replay that request over and over? Well,
turns out there is a hidden feature in there.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html">Sharing objects with presigned URLs</a> is a neat feature where you can sign a
request to download an object from S3 but, instead of making the request, you
just save the resulting URL. It looks like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">aws s3 presign s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/mydoc.txt --expires-in <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">604800</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<a href="https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mydoc.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=xxxx&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250516T002102Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=604800&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=xxxx">https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mydoc.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=xxxx&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250516T002102Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=604800&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=xxxx</a>
</p>

<p>
This URL looks a lot like the HTTP request we saw earlier, except some of the
headers are now parameters.
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s super cool about this is you can share access to <i>specific</i> objects
without sharing your actual credentials, and without requiring that the user who
consumes the link has an AWS SDK (or even knows what AWS is).
</p>

<p>
When you share the presigned URL, you need to be thoughtful about <i>how and
where</i> you share it. Think back to actually making a request - we relied on TLS
to keep our request private. How will you keep your presigned URLs private?
</p>

<p>
I just want to briefly pause and explain a common misconception about presigned
URLs: <i>it&rsquo;s just cryptography.</i> The URL you just saw is for a <i>bucket I do not
have access to</i>, generated by <i>invalid AWS credentials</i>. Click it (I dare you!),
it&rsquo;s not going to do anything. I can presign a request for any bucket, for any
object, in any region, even if I&rsquo;m stranded on a desert island with nothing but
my laptop, 1% battery, and the AWS CLI. When you presign a URL, there are
absolutely no network requests being made <i>to generate the signed URL</i><sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org234d315" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org234d315">Logging in to a database</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org234d315">
<p>
When we connect to a Postgres database, we&rsquo;re <i>authenticating</i> ourselves via one
of the authentication methods, and then we&rsquo;re taking the <code>LOGIN</code> action, which
must be <i>authorized</i>.
</p>

<p>
Or, put another way, we&rsquo;re making a request to <code>LOGIN</code>. What if logging in to
the database was an AWS API instead of a Postgres action?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">aws dsql login --cluster-id aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa --postgres-role my-application
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That doesn&rsquo;t help you connect to the database - you&rsquo;re going to need a Postgres
client like <code>psql</code> to do that. But it is an interesting idea, because as we&rsquo;ve
seen, AWS has a robust process for authentication and authorization. If we
<i>could</i> treat logging in like an API call then we get to ditch passwords. We
wouldn&rsquo;t be sending a password, we&rsquo;d be sending a signed request. And we now
know that signed requests are so much better. Signed requests don&rsquo;t contain a
password. Signed requests can&rsquo;t be used to generate other requests. Signed
requests automatically expire.
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ve probably taken the next step already. If we can&rsquo;t make a HTTPS API call
to login, because we need to be using the Postgres wire protocol with an
existing Postgres client, then maybe we can do one of those presigned URL
thingies? And that&rsquo;s exactly what DSQL does.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org884b0c2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org884b0c2">Authentication tokens and Postgres</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org884b0c2">
<p>
And so, this leads us to DSQL authentication tokens. They&rsquo;re just like presigned
URLs in S3. They&rsquo;re created by your SDK or CLI, and they&rsquo;re just a local
cryptographic operation. Here&rsquo;s an example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">aws dsql generate-db-connect-admin-auth-token --hostname my-cluster-id --expires-in <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">60</span>

<p>
my-cluster-id/?Action=DbConnectAdmin&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=xxxx&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250516T003940Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=60&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=xxxx
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s the point of this? Well, if you send an authentication token <i>instead of
a password</i>, then we&rsquo;re cooking. Then we have a way to authenticate you, without
you needing to use pesky, dangerous passwords:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>client -&gt; server: My name is <code>$user</code> and I&rsquo;d like to login to <code>$dbname</code></li>
<li>server -&gt; client: Sure, tell me your password</li>
<li>client -&gt; server: <code>$token</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
Tokens are just signed requests. DSQL will validate the signature, and then we
know you&rsquo;re really you. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like in practice:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">PGPASSWORD</span>=$<span style="color: #51afef;">(</span>aws dsql generate-db-connect-admin-auth-token --hostname $<span style="color: #dcaeea;">my_cluster_endpoint</span><span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>
psql --host $<span style="color: #dcaeea;">my_cluster_endpoint</span> --user admin
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I think this is super cool. Yes, you need to generate a token to connect, but
(really) think about the alternative. Passwords need to be rotated. So you&rsquo;re
going up against:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">PGPASSWORD</span>=$<span style="color: #51afef;">(</span>aws secrets-manager get-secret-value  ...<span style="color: #51afef;">)</span> <span style="color: #5B6268;"># </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">your password vault here</span>
psql --host $<span style="color: #dcaeea;">my_cluster_endpoint</span> --user admin
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In many cases, the traditional password based retrieval would require an API
call which may in turn have an associated cost or availability implication.
Generating a token is nearly free. It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s local. Every time you call an
AWS service, you&rsquo;re generating a token. It&rsquo;s been heavily optimized.
</p>

<p>
This technique wasn&rsquo;t invented by the DSQL team - it was invented by our friends
in RDS (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Connecting.html">Connecting to your DB instance using IAM authentication</a>).
</p>

<p>
When we were designing DSQL, we started with the assumption that, like RDS, we
would support both password authentication and the authentication token variant
of password authentication. But the more we thought about it, the more we
realized we had an opportunity to significantly raise the security bar and
reduce overall complexity.
</p>

<p>
The first thing we did is remove the concept of a <i>master password</i>. In DSQL,
there simply is no master password. You don&rsquo;t have to generate one when you
create a cluster. You don&rsquo;t need to decide between writing it down on a napkin
or, <i>sigh</i>, doing the right thing and setting up automatic rotation. It&rsquo;s just a
step that&rsquo;s been removed. You <i>already</i> needed AWS credentials to create the
cluster. Just use those same credentials to connect.
</p>

<p>
DSQL clusters always have a user named <code>admin</code>. This is your &ldquo;root&rdquo; user, it has
super powers. The way to login as admin is to generate an <i>admin token</i> as shown
above. For other users, just generate a non-admin token. Remember, tokens are
just &ldquo;APIs that haven&rsquo;t been called yet&rdquo;. The APIs are named:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DbConnectAdmin</li>
<li>DbConnect</li>
</ul>

<p>
After DSQL validates your token, it will proceed as any other AWS service does:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Lookup the policies for the authenticated caller</li>
<li>Look at the request</li>
<li>Evaluate whether the request should be allowed</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re logging in as the user &ldquo;admin&rdquo;, then you must have used the
DbConnectAdmin form, and you must have a policy that authorizes that action.
Here&rsquo;s what an example policy looks like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Effect"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"Allow"</span>,
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Action"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"dsql:DbConnectAdmin"</span>,
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Resource"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"arn:aws:dsql:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-cluster"</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>admin</code> user is responsible for bootstrapping other users by creating
Postgres roles and authorizing use of those roles:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">postgres</span>=&gt; CREATE ROLE example WITH LOGIN;
<span style="color: #dcaeea;">postgres</span>=&gt; AWS IAM GRANT example TO <span style="color: #98be65;">'arn:aws:iam::012345678912:role/example'</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Effect"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"Allow"</span>,
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Action"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"dsql:DbConnect"</span>,
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Resource"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"arn:aws:dsql:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-cluster"</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Take special note of the <code>GRANT</code> statement! This is a really important piece of
the puzzle. You need to explicitly state which IAM users and roles are allowed
in!
</p>

<p>
Connecting with the example role looks like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">my_cluster_id</span>=my-cluster-id
<span style="color: #dcaeea;">PGPASSWORD</span>=$<span style="color: #51afef;">(</span>aws dsql generate-db-connect-auth-token --hostname $<span style="color: #dcaeea;">my_cluster_id</span><span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>
psql --host $<span style="color: #dcaeea;">my_cluster_id</span> --user example
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So, what&rsquo;s up with the two tokens? Why not just have one token? We intentionally
kept DbConnect and DbConnectAdmin as separate actions to keep policy management
as simple as possible. Consider the wildcard policy:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Effect"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"Allow"</span>,
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Action"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"dsql:DbConnect"</span>,
  <span style="color: #51afef;">"Resource"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"*"</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This says that the caller may connect to any cluster. That&rsquo;s bad, right? No,
it&rsquo;s perfectly OK, and is actually what we were shooting for in our design.
Wildcard policies are simple. Simple works.
</p>

<p>
The reason this policy is safe is because of the <code>AWS IAM GRANT</code> statement shown
above. Logging into a DSQL cluster requires that DSQL service authorize the API
request to login (that&rsquo;s what the policy is for), but the cluster itself needs
to authorize the IAM entity. It&rsquo;s really straight forward to see who has access
to your cluster, because you can just look at the grants:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #dcaeea;">postgres</span>=&gt; select * from sys.iam_pg_role_mappings;
 iam_oid |                  arn                   | pg_role_oid | pg_role_name | grantor_pg_role_oid | grantor_pg_role_name
---------+----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+---------------------+----------------------
   <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">26398</span> | arn:aws:iam::012345678912:role/example |       <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">26396</span> | example      |               <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">15579</span> | admin
<span style="color: #51afef;">(</span><span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> row<span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now it might make more sense as to why we need two verbs. Every cluster always
has an &ldquo;admin&rdquo; user, just like every Postgres database has some kind of root
user. We need a way to express this special case, and make sure that it&rsquo;s
really, really hard to accidentally grant admin privileges to a database.

<p>
In DSQL, there are no passwords, ever. Instead, tokens are used to
<i>authenticate</i> who is trying to connect. Authentication tokens are generated by
the AWS SDK using fast, local cryptography and sent over the wire to DSQL
(instead of a password). After verifying a token, DSQL will evaluate the calling
identity&rsquo;s attached IAM Policies to ensure they have access to the cluster and
that the database administrator has authorized that identity to login.
</p>

<p>
Compared to passwords, tokens are significantly more secure because they have a
shorter lifespan that passwords which are either rotated infrequently or not at
all. Tokens are also operationally simpler because, unlike a password, there is
no need to orchestrate rotations, or make API calls to retrieve the current
password.
</p>

<p>
By leveraging Postgres&rsquo;s <i>Password</i> authentication, DSQL remains wire compatible
with Postgres. Existing clients, drivers and tools can simply use a token in
place of a password.

<p>
Tokens are used to <i>connect</i>. It is perfectly reasonable to generate a token
that expires in 1 second, connect, and then use that connection for an hour.
</p>

<p>
We recommend keeping token expiry as short as possible. The only requirement is
that the token is still valid (not expired) when it reaches DSQL. A few seconds
is usually more than enough time.

<p>
You can, but you almost certainly don&rsquo;t need to.
</p>

<p>
Consider an application using AWS DynamoDB doing many thousands of requests per
second per host. Every single one of those requests is an AWS API call to
DynamoDB <code>GetItem</code> or <code>PutItem</code>. Every single one of those requests is signed by
the AWS SDK. And, signing those requests is <i>more expensive</i> than generating a
DSQL token (because the requests simply have more bytes in them to process).
</p>

<p>
Token generation is <i>fast</i>, and is only used to <i>connect</i>. If you&rsquo;re running out
of CPU making tokens, something has gone horribly wrong, and caching isn&rsquo;t going
to help you.

<div id="outline-container-org4fd7cb8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4fd7cb8">Is token generation really a local operation?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4fd7cb8">
<p>
I get this question all the time, because nearly everything in the AWS SDK is
about calling APIs. But, I promise you, <i>generating</i> a presigned S3 URL or a RDS
or DSQL token involves nothing but CPU cycles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, but, but!&rdquo;" you say. Generating a token using the AWS SDK for Rust looks
like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-rust"><span style="color: #51afef;">let</span> <span style="color: #dcaeea;">token</span> = signer.db_connect_admin_auth_token<span style="color: #51afef;">(</span><span style="color: #bbc2cf; background-color: #282c34;">&amp;</span>sdk_config<span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>.<span style="color: #51afef;">await</span><span style="color: #c678dd; font-weight: bold;">?</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Why is there <code>await</code> there? Why is this cryptographic function using <code>async</code>?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What Color is Your Function?</a> is the answer to this mystery. You see, if you dig
into what that function does, you&rsquo;ll find that it needs credentials to do the
signing. Credentials are provided by credentials providers (!), and that&rsquo;s a
generic thing, and so it lands up being <code>async</code> because some of the providers
need to make network requests.
</p>

<p>
When you&rsquo;re running code in an environment that automatically provides
credentials (like EC2 or Lambda), the SDK will pick up credentials from that
environment by making a network request. This request doesn&rsquo;t go out over the
network, it just needs to leave your virtualized guest. Loading these
credentials is fast, local, reliable, and happens infrequently (the vended
credentials are valid for several hours).

<div id="outline-container-orgee3483f" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgee3483f">
<p>
No, it doesn&rsquo;t, due to architectural differences.
</p>

<p>
DSQL does have various limits and quotas, including a quota on how many new
connections you can open per second. This quota is quite generous by default,
and can be increased through the service quotas page. The connection rate quota
is <i>not a consequence</i> of authentication tokens.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgce906cd">
<p>
I agree, but it&rsquo;s not <i>token generation</i> that&rsquo;s slow. It&rsquo;s the CLI that&rsquo;s slow.
The AWS CLI is a fairly large Python application. Running
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">aws dsql generate-db-connect-admin-auth-token --hostname ...

fast</i>.
</p>

<p>
If, for some reason, you find yourself in a busy loop in a shell script
generating tokens, consider either caching tokens, or use a less generic tool
such as the token generator in <a href="https://github.com/marcbowes/aws-dsql-auth">aws-dsql-auth</a>.
