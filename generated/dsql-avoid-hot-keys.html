<h2 id="orgd5e0014">Aurora DSQL Best Practices: Avoid hot keys</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd5e0014">
<p>
In the <a href="dsql-circle-of-life.html">Circle of Life</a>, I describe the <i>flow</i> of data in Aurora DSQL. Data flows
from the Query Processor (QP), through the journal, and into storage. Once in
storage, it can be queried by future transactions.
</p>


<figure id="org052e248">
<img src="images/circle1.png" alt="circle1.png">

</figure>

<p>
There are many things to love about this design. My favorite is the elimination
of <i>eventual consistency</i>, at any scale, even when running in multi-Region
configuration. Pretty cool.
</p>

<p>
In today&rsquo;s article, I want to share a pattern that <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> work well with this
design: hot keys. What is a hot key? What are some examples of hot keys? Why
don&rsquo;t hot keys work well on DSQL? What should I use instead? Is this a forever
limitation? All this and more&#x2026; coming right up.
</p>

<p>
But first, let me tell you the good news: you don&rsquo;t have to worry about scale if
your application spreads <i>writes</i> over a well distributed range of keys.
Furthermore, in DSQL you (mostly) don&rsquo;t have to worry about scaling for reads
(even in read-write transactions). Let&rsquo;s jump in!
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org00b311d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org00b311d">Updating rows in DSQL</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org00b311d">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s say we have a simple blog hosted on DSQL:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">create</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">table</span> <span style="color: #c678dd;">posts</span> (
    id uuid <span style="color: #51afef;">primary</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">key</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">default</span> gen_random_uuid(),
    title <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">varchar</span>,
    visits <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">int</span>
);

<span style="color: #51afef;">insert</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">into</span> posts <span style="color: #51afef;">values</span> (<span style="color: #98be65;">'my favorite restaurants'</span>, <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">0</span>);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Every time a visitor comes along, we bump the number of visits:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">update</span> posts <span style="color: #51afef;">set</span> visits = visits + <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">where</span> id = ?;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What&rsquo;s happening under the covers when DSQL processes this update? First, DSQL
needs to read the <i>latest</i> row from storage:
</p>


<figure id="org450ca18">
<img src="images/hotkeys-read-counter.png" alt="hotkeys-read-counter.png">

</figure>

<p>
If no rows were returned, we&rsquo;re done. The query would return a row count of 0:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql">=&gt; <span style="color: #51afef;">update</span> posts <span style="color: #51afef;">set</span> visits = visits + <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">where</span> id = ?;
<span style="color: #51afef;">UPDATE</span> <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">0</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, in our case we&rsquo;ve picked blog post that does exist. The QP now has the
latest data in memory, and it updates the row. I&rsquo;m going to use JSON to
illustrate, because most of you don&rsquo;t speak Postgres&rsquo;s binary format:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{
    <span style="color: #51afef;">"id"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"edd54beb-3a86-4849-ab29-051ccba004c1"</span>,
    <span style="color: #51afef;">"title"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"my favorite restaurants"</span>,
    <span style="color: #51afef;">"visits"</span>: <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">0</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, the QP is going to update the row to the new value:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-json">{
    <span style="color: #51afef;">"id"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"edd54beb-3a86-4849-ab29-051ccba004c1"</span>,
    <span style="color: #51afef;">"title"</span>: <span style="color: #98be65;">"my favorite restaurants"</span>,
    <span style="color: #51afef;">"visits"</span>: <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And finally, we&rsquo;re going to commit:
</p>


<figure id="orgc63ae65">
<img src="images/hotkeys-write-counter.png" alt="hotkeys-write-counter.png">

</figure>

<p>
That&rsquo;s it! Transaction complete. <i>Later</i>, storage is going to read from the
journal and apply the update:
</p>


<figure id="orgba41cb3">
<img src="images/hotkeys-apply-counter.png" alt="hotkeys-apply-counter.png">

</figure>

<p>
While we were doing that, we had another visitor. I have great taste, and so
everybody wants to know what restaurants I like..
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">update</span> posts <span style="color: #51afef;">set</span> visits = visits + <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">where</span> id = ?;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What now? Well, same deal. Except we need to ensure the row that the QP fetches
has the updated <code>visits</code>, so that when it does <code>visits = visits + 1</code> we get the
right answer. As I discussed in the <a href="dsql-circle-of-life.html">Circle of Life</a>, we use <i>time</i> to ensure that
storage has seen all the updates. We&rsquo;ve put a lot of engineering effort into
making sure that storage <i>already</i> has the data by the time the next query comes
around, so that there is no need to wait.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org17869f5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org17869f5">Throughput and latency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org17869f5">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s pretend that the latency between the QP calling <i>commit</i> and storage
receiving the update is <i>hypothetically</i> 1 second (this number has been chosen
for easy math). How many times can I update this counter per second? Little&rsquo;s
Law!
</p>

<aside id="org1d8ed00">
<p>
In a system where arrivals wait in a queue to be processed, Little&rsquo;s Law relates
the average number of items in the system (L), the average arrival rate of items
(λ), and the average time items spend in the system (W) through the formula:
</p>

\begin{equation}
L = \lambda W
\end{equation}

<p>
For a stable system at maximum capacity, the arrival rate equals the throughput.
Rearranging the equation to solve for throughput gives: \(λ = L/W\). When
operating with a single item in the system (\(L=1\)), the formula simplifies to:
</p>

\begin{equation}
Throughput = \dfrac{1}{Latency}
\end{equation}
</aside>

<p>
So, if the QP→journal→storage path takes 1 second, then we can only bump the
visit counter once every second:
</p>

\begin{equation}
Throughput = \dfrac{1}{1s}
           = 1
\end{equation}

<p>
Let&rsquo;s put that into practice. I setup a test workload that ran exactly this
workload from an EC2 instance in the same region as my cluster:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Commit latency (p50)</dt><dd>~7ms</dd>
<dt>Transactions per second</dt><dd>~140</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Does Little agree?
</p>

\begin{equation}
Throughput = \dfrac{1}{Latency}
           = \dfrac{1000}{7}
           = 142
\end{equation}

<p>
This is absolutely not the best use of DSQL. We&rsquo;re getting 1.5KiB/sec of total
throughput. Sad trombone.
</p>

<p>
Of course, in this hypothetical system, the overall system (blog) isn&rsquo;t limited
to 140 visitors per second. It&rsquo;s any <i>single</i> page that&rsquo;s limited. The problem
is with the hot key (the counter), not the table, and not the cluster. For
example, if we add another post:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">insert</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">into</span> posts <span style="color: #51afef;">values</span> (<span style="color: #98be65;">'why peaches are the best fruit'</span>, <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">0</span>);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That post can <i>also</i> count views at ~140tps. Which means our hypothetical blog
can sustain up to 280 visitors per second if our visitors spread their interest
over both posts.
</p>

<p>
What exactly is a hot key? A hot key (or row) is a <span class="underline">row that is experiencing a
high volume of read or write requests</span>. Rows can be &ldquo;hot for read&rdquo; or &ldquo;hot for
write&rdquo;. In our example, we&rsquo;d say the key is <span class="underline">hot for write</span>, because it has
approached the speed limit of how frequently any single row can be updated.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2c8bb07" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2c8bb07">Hot for read</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2c8bb07">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s pretend we eliminated our visit counter. What happens if our restaurant
article starts to get popular? Each visitor needs to read the post row. At this
point, the post will experience more <i>read heat</i>. There are more and more QPs
hammering on the same row. As discussed in <a href="dsql-circle-of-life.html">the Circle of Life</a>, DSQL will detect
this read heat and add more storage replicas:
</p>


<figure id="orgaac7e8e">
<img src="images/circle4.png" alt="circle4.png">

</figure>

<p>
In DSQL, it&rsquo;s usually not a problem to have hot for read keys. As read heat
increases, DSQL will automatically scale out. Sudden <i>large</i> spikes will result
in increased latency while DSQL works to bring new capacity online. In a future
article, I&rsquo;ll dig into how DSQL scales in more detail.

<div id="outline-container-org6d27014" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6d27014">Conflicts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d27014">
<p>
As it turns out, our example blog is hosted on Lambda. DSQL works <i>really</i> well
with Lambda, because connections to DSQL are fast and cheap. But that&rsquo;s a story
for another day.
</p>

<p>
The question for today is: what happens when two people try and visit the same
post at the same time? Susan and Bobby both independently click the link. Lambda
is going to process their requests concurrently, over separate connections,
which means DSQL is going to see two page visits concurrently.
</p>

<p>
First, both Susan and Bobby read the current visit counter. Remember, the QP
needs to read the current row to know what the new counter should be:
</p>


<figure id="org42169c3">
<img src="images/hotkeys-read-counter-concurrently.png" alt="hotkeys-read-counter-concurrently.png">

</figure>

<p>
Both Susan and Bobby&rsquo;s QPs are going to see the same number of visits. These QPs
don&rsquo;t know about each other. They&rsquo;re separate processes, likely on different
physical machines. They both go to storage. They both see the same <i>latest</i>
number of visits. Both QPs are going to produce the same updated row.
</p>

<p>
Which means only one of these transactions can commit. The other is going to get
rejected due to a <i>write-write</i> conflict. In this case, Susan wins the race and
commits, while Bobby&rsquo;s transaction needs to retry.
</p>


<figure id="org911bba2">
<img src="images/hotkeys-write-counter-concurrently.png" alt="hotkeys-write-counter-concurrently.png">

</figure>

<p>
Bobby doesn&rsquo;t actually know about the failure to bump the page visit counter.
Bobby&rsquo;s QP returns an Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) error to Bobby&rsquo;s
Lambda function, and the <i>function tries again</i>. Bobby may experience slightly
elevated page load latency, but most humans aren&rsquo;t going to notice 7ms.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hot keys are anti-scale.</i> It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have 1 client running a
read-modify-write loop as fast as it can, or if you have 100 clients running a
read-modify-write loop as fast as they can. You&rsquo;re not going to get more
modifications per second than Little&rsquo;s Law allows.

<div id="outline-container-org5006a7a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5006a7a">Hot keys in the wild</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5006a7a">
<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://www.tpc.org/tpcc/">TPC Benchmark C</a> is an on-line transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
TPC-C looks like an eCommerce system. TPC-C scales quite nicely on DSQL, but the
schema has some hot spots in it. Let&rsquo;s take a look at two.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;new order&rdquo; transaction models purchasing an item in the system. Orders are
placed in &ldquo;districts&rdquo;. From the description:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the TPC-C business model, a wholesale parts supplier (called the Company
below) operates out of a number of warehouses and their associated sales
districts. The TPC benchmark is designed to scale just as the Company expands
and new warehouses are created. However, certain consistent requirements must be
maintained as the benchmark is scaled. Each warehouse in the TPC- C model must
supply ten sales districts, and each district serves three thousand customers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As part of processing an order, <a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/blob/main/src/main/java/com/oltpbenchmark/benchmarks/tpcc/procedures/NewOrder.java#L359"><code>NewOrder.updateDistrict</code></a> sets the next &ldquo;order
ID&rdquo;:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">UPDATE</span> district
   <span style="color: #51afef;">SET</span> D_NEXT_O_ID = D_NEXT_O_ID + <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span> <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">update the next order id</span>
 <span style="color: #51afef;">WHERE</span> D_W_ID = ?                    <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">for this warehouse</span>
   <span style="color: #51afef;">AND</span> D_ID = ?                      <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">&amp; this district</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<span class="underline">This limits the total number of orders per &ldquo;district&rdquo; per second.</span> So, if
somebody in your district buys a teddy bear, you need to wait for their order to
complete before you can get yours in. That&rsquo;s silly. All you want is that teddy
bear, you don&rsquo;t care about the order number! In a real application, you would
probably want to avoid giving out business information too.
</p>

<p>
This is an example of a <b>sequence</b>. You can build a sequence yourself like TPC-C
does, or try use Postgres&rsquo; <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsequence.html">CREATE SEQUENCE</a> or <code>BIGSERIAL</code> type (both are
currently disabled in DSQL). Sequences are inherently anti-scale. They can
create contention on read-modify-write loops, they can create conflicts, and
they create hot partitions within the system. Avoid sequences! For this example,
I think most people would look to something like a UUID or other random-number
technique for generating order ids.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s look at another example from TPC-C. As part of processing an order,
<a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/blob/main/src/main/java/com/oltpbenchmark/benchmarks/tpcc/procedures/Payment.java#L310"><code>Payment.updateWarehouse</code></a> rolls up payment information at the &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; level:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">UPDATE</span> warehouse
   <span style="color: #51afef;">SET</span> W_YTD = W_YTD + ?             <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">sum the year-to-date dollars</span>
 <span style="color: #51afef;">WHERE</span> W_ID = ?                      <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">for this warehouse</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<span class="underline">This limits the total number of payments per warehouse per second</span>, as each
payment needs to read the current YTD amount of sales made from this warehouse,
add the amount made by the current order, then produce a new row. This means
that even though &ldquo;Each warehouse [..] supply ten sales districts&rdquo;, only one of
those districts can process an order at the same time.
</p>

<p>
If you run into a pattern like this, ask yourself what you&rsquo;re really trying to
do. Does it matter that you have a strongly consistent sum of sales for the
current year per warehouse? Or, are you ok with some other reporting mechanism?
In TPC-C, there is a payment history table and you can run <code>sum()</code> queries over
that table to compute whatever you want. Current day, current month, just one
customer - whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
The payment history table is also the solution to our visitors problem. If we
created an access log like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">insert</span> <span style="color: #51afef;">into</span> visits (post_id, visited_at, referral_url, user_agent, <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">etc.</span>
  <span style="color: #51afef;">values</span> ( <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">etc.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we can use SQL to analyze visits in whatever way we want. You can compute
total visits by post, or trending pages this month, or top referrers, or&#x2026; Way
more flexible, and no hot key!
</p>

<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s look at a counter-example. What about the &ldquo;update stock&rdquo; query, that
runs as part of the new order transaction?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="color: #51afef;">UPDATE</span> stock
   <span style="color: #51afef;">SET</span> S_QUANTITY = ? ,              <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">lower the quantity of stock</span>
       S_YTD = S_YTD + ?,
       S_ORDER_CNT = S_ORDER_CNT + <span style="color: #da8548; font-weight: bold;">1</span>,
       S_REMOTE_CNT = S_REMOTE_CNT + ?
 <span style="color: #51afef;">WHERE</span> S_I_ID = ?                    <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">for this item</span>
   <span style="color: #51afef;">AND</span> S_W_ID = ?                    <span style="color: #5B6268;">-- </span><span style="color: #5B6268;">in this warehouse</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is a <i>good example</i> of what to do on DSQL. There are only so many teddy
bears in stock. You need to check if there is stock before selling one, and you
need to update stock after a sale. This example is going to scale well on DSQL:
presumably there are many different products being sold concurrently, and so
each item can be sold and accounted for separately.

<h3 id="org04bd09c">What about other databases?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04bd09c">
<p>
Hot keys are a problem on <i>every</i> database, not just DSQL. However, each
database has its own strengths and weaknesses, and so the story plays out
differently.
</p>

<p>
On instance-based Postgres, such as RDS, the read-modify-write loop is <i>way</i>
faster because the latest row value is usually available in memory. Commits may
also be quicker, depending on the <i>durability model</i> (&ldquo;can I lose data?&rdquo;) of the
service you&rsquo;re using. If you&rsquo;re running Postgres yourself, a commit may be as
simple as a <code>fsync()</code> to ensure the Write Ahead Log is made durable to local
storage. But, if that storage device fails, you&rsquo;ve lost data. On Aurora
Postgres, commits are only acknowledged after being replicated to multiple
availability zones&#x2026; which takes time. This improves durability, adds commit
latency, and therefore limits TPS for hot keys.

There are many ways to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implement-resource-counters-with-amazon-dynamodb/">Implement resource counters with Amazon DynamoDB</a>. Hot
keys have a maximum update rate of 1000/second, which you can achieve by using
update expressions to explicitly instruct the underlying partitions to increment
a counter:

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ aws dynamodb update-item <span style="color: #98be65;">\</span>
    --table-name counter <span style="color: #98be65;">\</span>
    --key <span style="color: #98be65;">'{"pk":{"S":"abc123"}}'</span> <span style="color: #98be65;">\</span>
    --update-expression <span style="color: #98be65;">"ADD quantity :change"</span> <span style="color: #98be65;">\</span>
    --expression-attribute-values file://values.json

$ <span style="color: #ECBE7B;">cat</span> values.json

In the fullness of time, we expect to be able to teach DSQL some of
these optimized access patterns, which will increase the throughput on a single
key. But never to infinity.
</p>

<p>
No matter the database you choose, you&rsquo;re going to find a limit to the
throughput you can get on a single key. For this reason, many applications find
themselves having to rethink their schema as they scale.

In this article we&rsquo;ve taken a deep dive into why <i>hot for write</i> keys can
prevent your application scaling on DSQL. When designing your schema, keep an
eye out for <i>sequences</i> and <i>statistics</i>, such as <i>counters</i> or <i>sums</i>.

<i>DSQL has been designed to scale horizontally,</i> so take advantage of that as you
design your schema.
