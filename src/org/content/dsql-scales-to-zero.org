* Aurora DSQL scales to zero

The [[https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/dsql/][Amazon Aurora DSQL]] landing page leads with:

#+begin_quote
Amazon Aurora DSQL is the fastest serverless distributed SQL database for always
available applications. Aurora DSQL offers the fastest multi-Region reads and
writes. It makes it effortless for customers to scale to meet any workload
demand with zero infrastructure management and zero downtime maintenance.
#+end_quote

Fantastic availability is definitely /one/ of the benefits of the DSQL
architecture. If you have a single point of failure then of course you're bound
by the availability of that single thing. If it fails, or if connectivity to it
fails, then you're down. That's why you can't rely on a single node - it's why
you need a /distributed system/. Once the system is capable of running across
multiple nodes, you might as well run those nodes in different Availability
Zones or AWS regions.

If all of this sounds expensive, well, that's the point of this article.

Historically speaking, you'd be right to be worried about cost. Historically
speaking, improving availability has been about buying expensive hardware to
improve reliability, plugging in redundant power and networking, or paying
expensive licensing fees for proprietary systems.

But DSQL changes all that. There is no "cheap" version of DSQL that has poor
availability, doesn't scale, and makes you manage infrastructure. There isn't a
license fee or other long-term commitment to make before you get the real deal.

** Scaling up, scaling down

#+begin_aside
If you haven't already, I recommend reading my [[file:dsql-circle-of-life.org][Circle of Life]] article to
understand the overall DSQL architecture.
#+end_aside

When we say /scale to meet any workload demand/, we don't just mean scale /up/,
we mean scale /down/ too. You see, when you connect to DSQL, it looks something
like this:

These connections can be from a single process, or from multiple processes
running on different machines (such as from AWS Lambda). DSQL doesn't care how
you're connecting. These QPs are /independent/ resources. This is part of the
secret sauce of availability. If the hardware running one of those QPs fails,
then it is unlikely that the /other/ QPs will fail at the same time in the same
way.

It's really worth pausing here. If you're thinking "hmm, that seems expensive",
I get it. After all, historically speaking, each node is expensive. It looks
like we've just added another node. It looks like connecting is going to be
slow. It looks like I need to either provision this node somewhere, somehow, or
tell DSQL up front how many QPs I need. Nope.

** Where do QPs come from?

Each QP is a Postgres process running inside a [[https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/][Firecracker]] MicroVM (μVM).
Firecracker is open-source technology, built by AWS, that blends the security
benefits of hardware virtualization with the speed and resource efficiency of
containers.

A QP is actually just a tiny slice of a machine. Here's a machine running a
bunch of QPs that are /ready to go/. They're just sitting there, waiting:

It's important to note that this /machine/ isn't yours - it's DSQL's. You're
just borrowing some capacity on it.

Somebody else can borrow some capacity too. If another customer opens 100
connections, some of those might land up on the same machine. Here, we show in
yellow that 2 QPs were chosen on the same machine:

virtual machine, and are isolated from all other customers. The same is true for
the yellow customer. The yellow customer can't even tell they have two

Is that what you were expecting?

** DSQL was designed to "scale to zero"

While we were designing DSQL, we met frequently with customers and members of
the AWS Hero community to ensure we building the right thing. The feedback we
were given time and again is: "Where is the relational version of DynamoDB?" and
"Will DSQL scale to zero?"

What customers love about DynamoDB is that there is /truly/ no underlying
instance to worry about. There's nothing to resize, nothing to patch or upgrade,
and no single point of failure to worry about.

If you create a DynamoDB Table and insert some data, then you pay for the
requests to insert that data. If you don't make any more requests, then you will
only pay for storage. There isn't a need to pay an hourly instance price,
because there truly isn't an instance to pay for.

If you come back to your Table after a few days of not using it, you can
immediately make read or write requests. Again, this is by design. There's
simply no need to spin up an instance to process those requests, because that's
just not how DynamoDB works.

Like DynamoDB, DSQL was designed scale to zero. If you close all your
connections, then you simply aren't using any QP capacity. If you aren't
using any capacity, then there's really no need to charge an hourly rate for
compute. Like DynamoDB, an idle DSQL cluster only pays for storage.

In this article, I've only described how the QP scales both up and down. What
about the other components? They have a story too. Each part of DSQL was
designed to scale both up and down based on the load given the system. The real
architecture is much more complex than I've shown here. Maybe we'll cover that
in a future article!

** Takeaways

DSQL has been designed to scale both up and down. When we talk about "scale to
meet any workload", we really mean it. We don't just mean up, we mean down too.
How far down? All the way to zero.

With DSQL, you /only pay for requests and storage/. If you have a cluster with
$10 worth of data (about 30GB) that you make zero requests to in a month, then
at the end of that month you will pay $10 for storage and $0 for requests.

Because the service has fundamentally been designed to scale horizontally in
tiny increments, DSQL considers going from 0→1 connections to be really the same
thing as going from 99→100 connections. In either case, you need another QP!

As a consequence of this design, DSQL is able to offer both per-request pricing
with no upfront commitments as well as the ability to rapidly scale up from
zero.
